#####This was an exercise that got out of hand
An experiment with Rspec and ActiveRecord without rails.  There is plenty of redundancy I am just demonstrating the different ways to run rspec tests.

I'll be building on this as I get into Hooks, Metadata, filters, Mocking, Stubbing.

I may end up turning it into a game. Who knows.
